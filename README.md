## Abstract/Executive Summary

VRBO is a rental company which allows individuals to put their homes, apartments, or rooms up for short term rent. It is extremely popular for people looking for places to stay during vacation. Unsurprisingly, the price of these apartments often determines how frequently they are rented. In this report, we will discuss the process of predicting the price of a new rental unit based on characteristics of that unit. This will help the client determine prices for new rentals to make them attractive to customers.  Data was collected from 1561 different rental units and included thirteen characteristics about each rental including its unit number, average satisfaction, number of reviews, and neighborhood along with the daily price of the rental. We used Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Logistic Regression to predict the price of a new rental. We found that Ridge Regression was the most effective model at predicting rental price. More specifically, we found that on average the predicted price from our Ridge Regression model was around 62 dollars and 35 cents off from the actual price. We further discuss our findings and the limitations of the study in the following paper.
